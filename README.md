# Project Overview

MaathaCare is a smart digital pregnancy support system designed to enhance Sri Lanka’s public maternal healthcare services through technology. Although the existing healthcare framework is strong, many processes remain manual and paper-based. This often results in missed clinic visits, irregular use of supplements, and difficulties in identifying and tracking high-risk pregnancies.

### For Pregnant Mothers
- Clinic and supplement reminders
- Pregnancy timeline guidance
- Digital storage of medical records
- Quick access to emergency contacts

### For Healthcare Officers (PHMs & MOH)
- Manage mother profiles
- Monitor clinic attendance
- View area-wise statistics
- Identify high-risk pregnancies using rule-based alerts

## Technology Stack

- **Mobile Application:** React Native  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
